1. Don't try to run commands to start the Tauri project as you can't check if it works or not.
2. Either only run the build in the frontend for types/build working, or in `src-tauri` to run Rust commands.
3. For UI design, use always HeroUI.
4. Use, when possible, Tanstack tools, like query, store, etc...
